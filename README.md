# Portfolio Project
 
This is a data analyst portfolio project completed following the guidance of YouTube tutorial video of Alex The Analyst.
URL of the video tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst

The tutorial consists of four videos which is very easy to follow and he leaves a lot of scope to use your own ideas to proceed. My dashboard is not exactly the same as Alex's and not so different either. I plan to update my this project with more SQL queries and visualizations. I am still learning the ropes and tricks and this might take some time. 

The dashboard created and posted is also published in my Tableau Public site.
